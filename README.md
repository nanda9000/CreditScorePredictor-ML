# CreditScorePredictor-ML
This project involves building a machine learning model to analyze and predict credit scores using a structured dataset. The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning data, handling missing values, and scaling features using techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data structure, visualizing key relationships, and identifying patterns.

Model Training: Employing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to predict credit scores.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports.
